## Pull Requests
1. Fork the [repo](https://github.com/malayli/SimpleShader.git)

2. Create a branch and implement your feature/bugfix & add test cases

3. The PR title (and commit title) must start with these following prefixes:
- `feat`: (new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)
- `fix`: (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
- `docs`: (changes to the documentation)
- `style`: (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)
- `refactor`: (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
- `test`: (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
- `chore`: (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)

Example:
```
feat: add hat wobble
^--^  ^------------^
|     |
|     +-> Summary in present tense.
|
+-------> Type: chore, docs, feat, fix, refactor, style, or test.
```

4. Ensure test cases & static analysis runs succesfully

5. Submit a pull request to `develop` branch
  
Please include unit tests where necessary to cover any functionality that is introduced.
  
## Coding Guidelines
* All features or bug fixes **must be tested** by one or more unit tests/specs.
* All API methods **must be documented** in a standard format and potentially in the user guide.
* All code must follow the style of the existing code.
* Remove the default Xcode header in each source file you created:
```
//
//  SourceFile.swift
//  AppName
//
//  Created by John Doe on 14/05/2024.
//
```
